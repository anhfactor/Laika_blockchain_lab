I really enjoyed playing around with the Laika Blockchain Lab! For someone who has used Postman before, the user interface was very similar, which is good. I also appreciated the dark theme built into the app.

While using the app, it was not apparent how we could save our work and come back to it later. Refreshing the page seem to have kept everything, but a save feature would be nice. It really nice if the app have application on windows, linux, mac like postman
